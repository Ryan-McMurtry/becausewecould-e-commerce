Full-Stack web application for a personal e-commerce brand using React.js and strapi. 

Currently working on homepage component and checkout functionality using Stripe. 

Bugfixes: 
-500 error when sending a request to Stripe servers. Not sure if I'm not getting a response on my backend or from Stripe api specifically.
